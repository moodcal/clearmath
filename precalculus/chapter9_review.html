<h4 id="systems-of-equations">Systems of Equations</h4>
<p>A system of equations is a set of equations that involve the same variables. A system of linear equations is a system of equations in which each equation is linear. Systems of linear equations in two variables <span class="arithmatex">\((x\)</span> and <span class="arithmatex">\(y)\)</span> and three variables <span class="arithmatex">\((x, y\)</span>, and <span class="arithmatex">\(z\)</span> ) have the following forms:</p>
<div class="arithmatex">\[
\begin{array}{cc}
\text { Linear system } &amp; \text { Linear system } \\
\text { 2 variables } &amp; \text { 3 variables } \\
a_{11} x+a_{12} y=b_{1} &amp; a_{11} x+a_{12} y+a_{13} z=b_{1} \\
a_{21} x+a_{22} y=b_{2} &amp; a_{21} x+a_{22} y+a_{23} z=b_{2} \\
&amp; a_{31} x+a_{32} y+a_{33} z=b_{3}

\]</div>
<p>A solution of a system of equations is an assignment of values for the variables that makes each equation in the system true. To solve a system means to find all solutions of the system.</p>
<h4 id="substitution-method">Substitution Method</h4>
<p>To solve a pair of equations in two variables by substitution:</p>
<ol>
<li>Solve for one variable in terms of the other variable in one equation.</li>

</ol>
<h4 id="elimination-method">Elimination Method</h4>
<p>To solve a pair of equations in two variables by elimination:</p>
<ol>
<li>Adjust the coefficients by multiplying the equations by appropriate constants so that the term(s) involving one of the variables are of opposite signs in the equations.</li>
<li>Add the equations to eliminate that one variable; this gives an equation in the other variable. Solve for this variable.</li>
<li>Back-substitute the value(s) of the variable that you have found into either original equation, and solve for the remaining variable.</li>
</ol>
<h4 id="graphical-method">Graphical Method</h4>

</ol>
<h4 id="how-to-determine-the-number-of-solutions-of-a-linear-system">How to Determine the Number of Solutions of a Linear System</h4>
<p>When Gaussian elimination is used to solve a system of linear equations, then we can tell that the system has:</p>
<ol>
<li>No solution (is inconsistent) if we arrive at a false equation of the form <span class="arithmatex">\(0=c\)</span>, where <span class="arithmatex">\(c\)</span> is nonzero.</li>

</ol>

<li>One solution if each variable in the row-echelon form is a leading variable.</li>
