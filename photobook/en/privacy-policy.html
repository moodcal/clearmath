    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
    
    <p>Last Updated: April 1, 2025</p>
    
    <p>This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, and protect your information when you use our Baby Record application (referred to as "the App" or "our App"). Your privacy is critically important to us, and we are committed to being transparent about our data practices.</p>
    
    <h2>1. Information Collection and Use</h2>
    <p>We value your privacy and designed our App with data minimization in mind:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>We do not collect any personal information beyond what is necessary for the App to function.</li>
        <li>Photos and videos are only stored on your device and personal iCloud account.</li>
        <li>We do not analyze, access, or transfer your content to external servers.</li>
        <li>We do not use analytics services that collect identifiable information.</li>
        <li>All content created within the App (such as records, notes, and photos) is saved only on your device and in your iCloud account (if you've enabled synchronization).</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2>2. Data Storage and Protection</h2>
    <p>We protect your data through the following measures:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>All your data is stored locally on your device and in your personal iCloud account if syncing is enabled.</li>
        <li>Data transmission between your device and iCloud is protected by Apple's security protocols.</li>
        <li>We don't have access to your data in iCloud as it's encrypted and only accessible with your Apple ID.</li>
        <li>We do not maintain backend servers for storing your personal data or media files.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2>3. Photo Library Access</h2>
    <p>Regarding access to your device's photo library:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>The App requests access to your photo library only for importing photos and videos you specifically select.</li>
        <li>This access is only used when you explicitly choose to import media.</li>
        <li>You can revoke this permission at any time through your device settings.</li>
        <li>We do not scan or upload content from your photo library.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2>4. Children's Privacy</h2>
    <p>We take children's privacy protection seriously:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Our App is designed for family use and complies with privacy laws regarding children.</li>
        <li>We do not knowingly collect personal information from children.</li>
        <li>As all data stays on your device or personal iCloud account, parents maintain full control over their children's data.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2>5. Third-Party Services</h2>
    <p>Our App uses limited third-party services:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>iCloud: For syncing data between your devices (if you enable this feature).</li>
        <li>We do not use third-party analytics tools, advertising networks, or tracking services.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2>6. Your Rights</h2>
    <p>As a user, you have the following rights:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Access: You can access all your data within the App at any time.</li>
        <li>Deletion: You can delete your data from the App, or completely uninstall the App to remove all local data.</li>
        <li>Data Control: You can enable or disable iCloud sync to control where your data is stored.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2>7. Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time.</li>
        <li>We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy in the App and on this page.</li>
        <li>You are advised to review this Privacy Policy periodically for any changes.</li>
        <li>Your continued use of the App will be considered acceptance of our updated policy.</li>
    </ul>
